What makes a test trustworthy?

If a test passes you know that the production code is... maybe working.
If the test failed you know that something is wrong with the production code.

How can we write trustworthy tests?

There are 2 ways to write tests
    1. using Test Driven Development (TDD)
    2. code-first (writing tests after the production code)

Code first is a little bit risky because you may test the wrong thing.
The test may pass but the production code might still have a bug.

Solution?

Make a little change to break the test(s) on the line that is
supposed to make the test pass.
Create a bug, return a different value, comment out that line...

If the test(s) still pass it means the test(s) don't test the right thing.

Make sure you write trustworthy tests that give you value!
