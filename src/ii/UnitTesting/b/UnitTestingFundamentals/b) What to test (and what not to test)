What to test? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TEST!!!

When you don't know what to test it is
probably because you have poorly written code.

Ex: methods with more than 10 lines of code

public int IHave500LinesOfCode()
{
    ...
}

Unit testing and clean coding go hand in hand.
In order to test it the code must be clean
and properly structured. Testability!

Clean code is easy to test <=> easy to test code is clean.

Assuming the code is clean you should always
test the outcome of a function.

Types of functions:
    - queries: return some value
        - test all execution paths and ensure
            each path returns the right value
    - commands: perform an action, do not return any value
        - test the outcome of this method (change of state)
        - test if it communicated with the external resource
            like DB, web service, API... (spy)
        - sometimes commands return results
            (ex: create reservation)

What NOT to test?

- language features
- 3rd party code
- only test YOUR CODE!
