This is just a guideline! The actual ratio you need depends on the application.

Unit tests are good at testing the logic
of the application (conditional statements and loops).
Methods with complex logic and calculations should be tested with unit tests.

Summary:
    - unit tests are favorable.
    - integration tests cover gaps between unit tests.
    - use end-to-end tests sparingly.
