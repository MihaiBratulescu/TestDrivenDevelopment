Test double <- Dummy <- Stub <- Spy <- Mock
            <- Fake

1. The dummy
    - implements an interface
    - all functions do nothing
    - all functions returns values as close to nothing as possible
    - used when you test an execution path that does NOT care about the interface

2. Sub
    - does not return 0 or null
    - returns value(s) required by the test
    - returns special fixed values
    - used to drive the code through special execution paths
    - reused by multiple tests

3. Spy
    - remembers the way it was called
    - used to test external services (check if it was called correctly)
    - tests interaction
    - couples tests to the algorithm!

4. True Mock
    - it knows what should happen
    - remembers in it's internal state what was supposed to happen
    - instead of looking at recorded call the true mock can compute the expected result
    - basically it's checking on what it spied
    - give the useful advantage of having the recording and the computing in the same place

5. Fake
    - is a simulator
    - contains real logic
    - kind of looks like the real deal
    - get's complicated super fast
    - easy to loose control of them
    - require their own tests
