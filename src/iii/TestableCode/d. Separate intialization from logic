Have you ever mixed together object construction & lookup with the logic?

Of course! Why keep them separate (add seams) if you never written tests?

You now have to do some unlearning!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The two responsibilities need to be separated!

If you separate the two testing can become trivial (or at least very easy).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, how to write hard to test code?

You mix object creation with business logic!

This will ensure that a test can never construct an object graph different
from the production one. Hence nothing can be tested in isolation.
