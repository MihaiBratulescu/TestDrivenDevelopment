When you write your tests first you are forced to design
your production code to be accessible from your tests.

Since you haven't written the production code yet tests
have a high influence on the design of the production code.

And that influence will make the production code testable.

And another word for testable is decoupled!

The only way to tests lines of code is to access them from
the tests, but the only way to access them is to decouple
the functions that contain them.

Therefore the act of writing your tests first causes you
to have a system that is far less coupled than it would have
been otherwise.

YOU GET A BETTER DESIGN JUST FOR WRITING YOUR TESTS FIRST!

The difficult goal of decoupled code becomes trivial!
