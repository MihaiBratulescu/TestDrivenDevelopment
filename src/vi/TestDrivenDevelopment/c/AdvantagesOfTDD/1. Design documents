What do you first read when checking out a 3rd
party library?

You look at the code examples!

The unit test we write serve as the code examples
of the system.

Want to know how to create an object?
Want to know how to call some API function?

The tests are a low level design documents.
They are also so formal that they execute and
NEVER get out of date with the application!

The costs of documenting software is high and
mostly unreliable!
