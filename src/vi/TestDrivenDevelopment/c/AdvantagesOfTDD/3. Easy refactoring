Remember why code rots?

But what if you had a suite of tests that proved to a
high degree that the system worked?

What if you knew that those tests covered almost
everything in the system?

The tests would eliminate the fear!
The tests would allow you to clean the code!

-----------------------------------------------

Nothing makes a system more flexible
than a suite of tests!

If you received a perfectly designed system
but no tests you would be afraid to change and
and improve it, so over time it will gradually
degrade and break!

What about the opposite?

-----------------------------------------------------

Can't we just test after?

That would be boring... you already know the code works...

Some parts are difficult to test! So you'll take shortcuts!

Besides would you want to write a failing test?

You would never trust those tests!
