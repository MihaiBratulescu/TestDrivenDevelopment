-transient: is created and destroyed around every test
-persistent: survives from test to test
-fresh: initialized every test
-shared: allows state to accumulate between tests

1. Transient fresh
2. Persistent fresh
3. Persistent shared

They are not mutually exclusive.

But setups can get very large!!!
Use tests hierarchy!
