-transient: is created and destroyed around every test
-persistent: survives from test to test
-fresh: initialized every test
-shared: allows state to accumulate between tests

1. Transient fresh (new plate)
2. Persistent fresh (clean plate)
3. Persistent shared (eat on dirty plate)

They are not mutually exclusive.

But setups can get very large!!!
Use tests hierarchy!
