What if we had a suite of tests that was so comprehensive that
virtually no bug could escape it?

What if that suite of tests could execute
in a matter of minutes?

And what if that suite of tests could never get
out of date with the system?

What effect would that suite of tests have
on the fear of changing the code?

What if we had a suite of tests that, if it passes, we ship it!

----------------------------------------------------------------

By maintaining a test suite that has very high coverage
(and quick runtime) it would be REALLY hard for a defect
to get through that kind of defense.

But keeping defects under control is just one of the benefits
of such a suite of tests!

Another benefit is that we are not afraid to make changes to
the code, we are not afraid to CLEAN IT!

*DEMO MOVIE RENTAL*

---------------------------------------------------------

The tests save us a MASSIVE amount of time for day one!

It let's us develop faster and safer,
there are fewer defects, less debugging, etc.

We can code faster and CODE BETTER!

But how do we can (practically) create such a suite?
