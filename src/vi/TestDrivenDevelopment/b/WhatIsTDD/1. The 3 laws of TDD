TDD is a discipline and as a discipline it has a set of rules.

Writing a hole bunch of tests whenever you feel like
is not a discipline and does not make you a TDD developer.

Examples of other disciplines:
    - doctors washing hands
    - gun trigger discipline
    - behaviour at a martial arts dojo

These disciplines may seem extreme and harsh (even exaggerated)
but they are imposed (strictly) to ensure safety and effectiveness.

---------------------------------------------------------

The first 3 disciplines of TDD are knows as the 3 laws.

Like any discipline, to the uninitiated these laws seem extreme
and absurd just like hand washing seemed absurd to the doctors
of the XIX century.

1. Write NO production code except to pass a failing test.

2. Write only ENOUGH of a test to demonstrate a failure.

3. Write only ENOUGH production code to pass the test.
