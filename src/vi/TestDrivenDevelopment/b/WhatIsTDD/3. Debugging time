Imagine a group of developers following these 3 laws.

Pick one of them! It doesn't matter who and it doesn't matter when!

Everything they were working on in the last ~5 minutes was working!

What would your life be like if everything worked 2 minutes ago?

How much debugging would you do?

With so little time invested in creating the bug removing it
would not be very hard. In fact it would be hard to spend a
lot of time debugging something that worked 1 minute ago.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Are you good at the debugger?

Do you know all the hotkeys?
Do you know how to set a break point and then set a watch point
and get to the break point 5 times and then get to the second
break point 3 times and then set the watch point so that the variable
get's to 55 so you can start debugging?

Debugging is not a skill to be desired!

You can't be that good at debugging without
spending a lot of time doing it.

You don't want to be spending your time debugging, you want to
be spending your time writing code that works!

PRODUCTIVITY is inversely proportionate to DEBUG TIME

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you mean we'll never have bugs?!

No, you will still have horrible bugs that can take
a day (or more) to debug but if you follow the
3 laws that will happen far less often.
