Test double:
    - replaces real class
    - same interface
    - different behaviour

Mocks:
    - generated class (by a framework)
    - doesn't do anything
        (default behaviour: void does nothing, returns default values)
    - behaviour verification
        (remembers what methods were called)

Stubs:
    - handwritten class
    - returns redefined responses (hardcoded)
    - state verification
